# Mechanisms-Underlying-Immunodynamics-of-Layered-Defences-Elicited-by-mRNA-Vaccination-in-Children


### Overview
This repository contains supporting files for the results reported in "Mechanisms-Underlying-Immunodynamics-of-Layered-Defences-Elicited-by-mRNA-Vaccination-in-Children"


### Features
   - Feature 1: simulate biomarker trajectories based on Monolix output: Anti-S-IgG, nAbs, S+MBC, IFN-g and IL2
   - Feature 2: Survival analysis: Cox-PH model with time-varying covariate 
   - Feature 3: Estimation of the protection duration of children with hybrid immunity

### Data (some datasets are not available)
  - Monolix output (biomarkers): population parameters, estimated individual parameters, simulated individual parameters
  - Original data: biomarkers raw data, individual immunity-conferring event information (immu_detail_individuals.csv) 
  - Simulated data: simulated biomarker trajectories for survival analysis and protection estimation
